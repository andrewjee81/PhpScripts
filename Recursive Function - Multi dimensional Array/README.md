## Introduction
This PHP code is designed to structure and combine data from multiple arrays ($workspace, $ticket, $label, and $people) into a single nested array format, and then output it as a JSON string. This project demonstrates how to handle and merge complex data structures using PHP.

Final data needed to be in a multidimensional array with grouping. I wrote a recursive foreach function to group these data together. 

## Features

Data Structuring: Combines multiple arrays into a nested structure.

Hierarchical JSON Output: Converts the nested structure to a JSON string for easy use.

Flexible Function: The doArray function is designed to handle different levels of nesting and matching keys.
